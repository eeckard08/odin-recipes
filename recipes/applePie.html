        <p>
            This is the apple pie that my Grandma used to make for us when we were younger.
            Sadly, Grandma passed just a few months ago, but this recipe lives on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important part of this recipe is making sure that all of the ingredients
            are bought fresh from your local market.  Remember to smell your apples before buying.
