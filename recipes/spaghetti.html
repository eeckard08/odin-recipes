            Okay, so this recipe is actually one of my own creations.  It's fantastic
            and can be used as a base for lasagna
        </p>
        <p>
            For this recipe the most important aspect is making sure that the vegetables and meat 
            have plenty of time to simmer in the pot or slow cooker before eating.
